# 🍷 Red Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Red Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
The goal is to analyze chemical properties of red wine and understand how they affect wine quality.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Samples:** 1,599 red wines  
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical variables  
- **Target:** Quality score (0–10)

## 🔍 Objectives
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Identify correlations between wine quality and physicochemical properties.
- Highlight key insights useful for predictive modeling.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Alcohol has the strongest positive impact on wine quality.  
- Volatile acidity negatively affects quality.  
- Sulphates show a moderate positive correlation.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Apply machine learning models to predict wine quality.  
- Extend analysis to white wine dataset for comparison.
